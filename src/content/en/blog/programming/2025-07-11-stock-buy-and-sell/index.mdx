In this blog, we will solve a problem that comes up in ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ Amazon ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ interviews.

## Problem:

You are given an array containing stock prices for consecutive days. You can buy a stock and sell it on a subsequent day. You can only hold one share at a time. If you can buy and sell as many times as you want, what is the maximum profit you can make?
Example:

<Explanation
  explanations={[
    {
      id: 1,
      input: "arr[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]",
      output: "865",
      explanation:
        "You buy the stock on day 0 and sell on day 3, making a profit of 310-100=210. Then, you buy on day 4 and sell on day 6, making a profit of 695 - 40 = 655. The total profit is 865.",
    },
  ]}
/>
## Solution:

**Main Idea**: The total possible profit is the sum of the differences between
the lowest and highest values of each consecutive increasing segment. For arr[]=[100,
180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695], the consecutive increasing segments are from 100 to
310 and from 40 to 695. For arr[]=[4, 2, 2, 2, 4], the consecutive increasing segment
is from 2 to 4.

1. We will use a variable named min to store the lowest value of each
   consecutive segment. If a value smaller than min appears, our increasing sequence
   has ended. Therefore, we add the possible profit from this sequence (maxProfit) to
   the total profit and update the value of min.
2. If there is a value greater than min,
   this element could be either decreasing or increasing compared to the previous element.
   Therefore, we define this logic inside the else block.

- If it is less than the previous
  element, it means our sequence has ended. In this case, we add the profit and consider
  that a new sequence is starting.
- If it is greater than the previous element, we will
  calculate the potential profit for this sequence.

        for(int i=1;i<length;i++){
            if(arr[i]<min){
                min=arr[i];
                profit+=maxProfit;
                maxProfit=0;
