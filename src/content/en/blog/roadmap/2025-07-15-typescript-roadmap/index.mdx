Things we learned new after generally going through the typescript roadmap from roadmap.sh site

In order to strengthen our knowledge, we are generally looking at **roadmaps** from [this site](https://roadmap.sh/). This time we looked at the [typescript](https://roadmap.sh/typescript) roadmap.

### Let's list the new knowledge we learned.

1. Typescript compiles (means converts) and becomes javascript.
2. We learned the type difference between **unknown and any**. The unknown type is used for unknown types. From the unknown type, you need to validate the type using typeof, instanceof, etc.
3. You can declare constants using the **enum** type. After compilation, it remains as a constant.

4. The **tuple** type is used to specify that the elements inside an **array** are exactly like this. For example, you can store color codes in an array.
   type RGBcolor= [number,number,number]
   const redColor= [255,0,0]

5. I'm still wondering how to use the never type.
6. We looked at **type assertion** using **as**, **satisfies**, **! or no-null-assertion**, **as const**.
7. In type guards (type guards, type narrowing), there are `type-predicates`.
   This validates that a variable is of this type. The isString function in the example code validates. If you look carefully, there's `value is string`.

```function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
return typeof value === 'string';
}
function example(x: unknown) {
if (isString(x)) {
// We can now call any 'string' method on 'x'.
x.toUpperCase();
} else {
console.log(x);
}
}
```

8. Function overloading makes functions super powerful.
9. Using generic types, you define general types.
10. Decorators are used to give additional capabilities to functions.
11. Utility types make it easier for you to define types. In the example below, **Record** is a utility type.

```
const user:Record<string, number | string>={
name:'john',
age:10
}
```

12. What is conditional type?
13. Using namespace, internal module, external module, namespace augmentation, global augmentation, we can make our code more organized.
