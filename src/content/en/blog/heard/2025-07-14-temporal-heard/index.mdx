I am wondering what tech leaders talk ...

## Note:

1. [Who is **Preeti Somal**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preeti-somal-131890/)?  
   She is currently working as a senior engineering leader at an open-source company called **Temporal**.  
   Since 2008, she has been involved in cloud technology and has worked at major companies such as **Yahoo** and **VMware**.

2. [**Temporal**](https://github.com/temporalio) is a platform that allows developers to focus solely on technical logic during development.
