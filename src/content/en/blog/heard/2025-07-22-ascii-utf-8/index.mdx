This time we will see how computers understand and display the text we write.

Actually, I myself don't understand it very well at the moment. First, let me directly write down everything I understand.
Have you ever heard that data transmitted over the internet consists of only two things: 1 and 0?
So all data consists of only 1 and 0.
To store the text we write in 1s and 0s, we initially used **ascii** and later started using **utf-8**.
