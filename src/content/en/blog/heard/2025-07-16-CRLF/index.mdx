title: What is CRLF?

We will share what we heard about CRLF from Hanselman's series _The Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You_.

Before we typed on computers, we used typewriters.

As you can see from the image above, there were two components called **carriage return** and **line feed**. The purpose of the **carriage return** was to bring the writing tool back from the end of the paper to the beginning, while the **line feed** helped move the paper down one line.

To display text in an orderly way on computers, we use **\r for carriage return** and **\n for line feed**. However, operating systems handle this differently.

Windows operating systems use **\r\n**, while modern Mac and Linux systems use **\n**.

So, if you open a file created on Windows in a Linux system, it may not display correctly.

Text editors like VSCode and Notepad can display any file correctly. Also, in Git, you can configure and convert line endings when merging code.
